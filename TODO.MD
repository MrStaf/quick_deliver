Building a WYSIWYG editor from scratch can be a challenging task, but it is achievable using React. Here are the steps you can follow to build a basic WYSIWYG editor in React:

Set up the project:
Create a new React project using your preferred tools (e.g., create-react-app) and install any necessary dependencies.

Define the Editor component:
Create a new component that will serve as the WYSIWYG editor. This component will contain the toolbar, the editable content area, and any other necessary components.

Add the contentEditable attribute:
In the editable content area, add the contentEditable attribute to make it editable.

Add the toolbar:
Create a toolbar component that will contain the formatting options (e.g., bold, italic, underline, etc.) and any other necessary options.

Create functions for handling formatting:
Write functions that will handle the formatting options selected by the user, such as bold, italic, underline, and others.

Handle user input:
Add event listeners to the editable content area to detect user input, and call the appropriate formatting functions based on the user's selections.

Render the content:
Use React to render the formatted content in the editable content area.

Add undo/redo functionality:
Write functions that will allow users to undo or redo their changes.

Save the content:
Write a function that will save the formatted content to a database or file.

These are just the basic steps, and there may be other functionality you'll want to add to your WYSIWYG editor. However, this should give you a good starting point to create a functional editor. You may also want to explore existing libraries and frameworks, such as Quill or Draft.js, which can simplify the process of building a WYSIWYG editor.
